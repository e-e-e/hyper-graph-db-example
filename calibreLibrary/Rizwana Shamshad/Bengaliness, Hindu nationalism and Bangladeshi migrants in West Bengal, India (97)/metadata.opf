        <dc:description>Hindu nationalists made migration from Bangladesh an election campaign in West
Bengal during the 1990s. Although there were various allegations against Bangladeshi
migration, it never became a mainstream political issue in the state, like in neighbouring
Assam. West Bengal shares the longest border with Bangladesh, compared to any
other Indian state, and hosts a large number of Bangladeshi migrants, according to the
Census reports in India. West Bengal and Bangladesh share a common ethnicity, both
are predominantly Bengali. Can this shared Bengaliness explain why Bangladeshi
migration did not become a divisive political issue in the state? If this sameness is a
bonding factor, what about the Ghoti-Bangal differences? Drawn from in-depth interviews
with the representatives of West Bengalâ€™s key civil society organisations and
political parties, I argue that a particular historical and cultural process, unique to West
Bengal and Bangladesh, has shaped the current attitude towards Bangladeshi migrants
in the state.</dc:description>
