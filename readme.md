# A personal hyper-graph-db playground

This is just a repository to share experimentations with [hyper-graph-db](https://github.com/e-e-e/hyper-graph-db).

`calibreLibrary/**` is a directory of [opf](https://github.com/e-e-e/open-packaging-format) data from a Calibre library.

## to play

To setup remember to install dependencies: `npm install`.

Then to populate the graph database run: `npm run fresh`.

And finally use `node index.js` to run current playground.
